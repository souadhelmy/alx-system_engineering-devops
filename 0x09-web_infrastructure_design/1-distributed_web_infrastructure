let's address the specifics of the infrastructure:

Load Balancer (HAproxy): The load balancer is added to distribute incoming traffic evenly across multiple servers.
It helps optimize resource utilization and improves the availability and scalability of the website.

Web Server (Nginx): The web server handles HTTP/HTTPS requests and serves static files for the website.
It is responsible for handling incoming connections and serving responses.

Application Server: The application server processes dynamic content and executes the codebase for the website.
It receives requests from the web server, performs necessary logic or computations, and generates dynamic responses.

Application Files: The set of application files contains the codebase for the website. 
These files reside on the servers and are accessed by the application server to process user requests.

Database (MySQL): The MySQL database stores and manages the website's data. 
It consists of a primary-replica (master-slave) cluster to provide high availability and data redundancy.

Primary Node: The primary node is responsible for handling write operations, such as inserting, 
, or deleting data. It ensures data consistency and integrity.

Replica Node: The replica nodes synchronize data from the primary node and handle read operations. 
They provide high availability and scalability by serving read queries and acting as backups in case the primary node fails.

Next, let's discuss the issues with this infrastructure:

Single Point of Failure (SPOF): The infrastructure has a potential single point of failure at the load balancer.
If the load balancer fails, it can disrupt the distribution of traffic and impact the availability of the website. 
Implementing redundancy measures, such as adding additional load balancers in a cluster, can mitigate this issue.

Security Issues: The infrastructure lacks security measures such as firewalls and HTTPS. Without firewalls,
the servers are more vulnerable to unauthorized access or attacks. Enabling HTTPS with SSL/TLS encryption is essential to secure communication between users
and the website, protecting sensitive data during transmission.

Monitoring: The infrastructure does not include a monitoring system, which is crucial for tracking the health,
performance, and availability of the components. Implementing a monitoring solution would allow proactive detection of issues,
such as server failures or performance bottlenecks, and enable prompt troubleshooting and maintenance.

By addressing these issues, such as adding redundancy to eliminate single points of failure, 
implementing security measures like firewalls and HTTPS, and incorporating a monitoring system, 
the infrastructure can be enhanced in terms of availability, security, and proactive maintenance.
